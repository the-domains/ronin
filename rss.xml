            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why houses are not an investment, aka, the argument I had with my wife</h1><p>My wife and I have fundamentally different approaches to risk assessment and investing. She has a defined benefit pension and no other investments, while I'm actively building and managing my own portfolio.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Options are more complicated than that 4 page pdf lead you to believe...</h1><p>You know when you finished that 'options made easy' document and thought "now I can forget about stocks and take over the world".

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Mr. Money Mustache is like a Lamborghini</h1><p>Am I allowed to use his name in the title of my post? If you're familiar with Mr. Money Mustache, then you know that title is nonsensical. What I meant is that he is a person to be admired, and, more than that, he lives a lifestyle that one could aspire to.</p><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wealthyronin.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2013-lamborghini-veneno-11.jpg?resize=800%2C550"></article>]]></description>
